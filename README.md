# GameFi meets DeFi: Character Staking for Yield ðŸŽ®ðŸ’°

This project allows players to stake their game character NFTs to earn yields, powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. By leveraging advanced encryption techniques, the platform calculates mining efficiencies based on the encrypted attributes of character NFTs, creating a seamless bridge between gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi).

## The Challenge: Making Game Assets Valuable 

In the rapidly evolving world of GameFi, players often struggle to derive real financial value from their in-game assets. Traditional models leave players uninspired, as their hard-earned NFTs lack viable opportunities for profit. Furthermore, concerns about privacy and security in financial transactions hinder the growth of innovative applications. The challenge lies in creating a system where gamers can not only enjoy their characters but also earn rewards without compromising the confidentiality of their assets.

## How FHE Addresses These Challenges

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology provides a revolutionary solution, enabling calculations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. In this project, encrypted attributes of character NFTsâ€”like rarity and levelâ€”are processed to determine the mining efficiency within a DeFi pool. By employing Zama's open-source libraries, including **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we ensure that players' data stays private while still yielding valuable insights and rewards.

### Key Features

- **Encrypted Character Attributes**: The platform maintains the confidentiality of character attributes through FHE encryption, ensuring secure transactions.
- **Dynamic Yield Calculation**: Mining yield is calculated using homomorphic properties, allowing users to earn based on their NFT's gameplay characteristics.
- **Tangible Financial Value**: By linking gaming assets directly to DeFi yields, players can turn their passion for gaming into a lucrative venture.
- **User-Friendly Staking Interface**: A visually appealing dashboard for staking and tracking character attributes, designed to enhance user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Essential for confidential computing.
- **Solidity**: For smart contract development.
- **Node.js**: For building server-side applications.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For smart contract testing and deployment.
- **React.js**: For a dynamic front-end experience.

```

## Getting Started

To set up the project, please follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following on your machine:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Hardhat or Foundry for Ethereum development

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the project files**, ensuring you have the complete directory structure as outlined above.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run the command below to install the necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Configure your environment variables as necessary for your development environment.

## Build & Run the Project

Now that the setup is complete, you can compile and run the project with the following commands:

- **To compile the contracts**:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

- **To run tests**:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```

- **To deploy the contracts**:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
  ```

## Example Snippet: Staking a Character

Hereâ€™s a quick code snippet illustrating how to stake a character NFT:

```javascript
async function stakeCharacter(characterId) {
    const characterStakingContract = await ethers.getContractAt("Character_Staking", contractAddress);
    const stakingResult = await characterStakingContract.stakeCharacter(characterId);
    console.log(`Staked character with ID: ${characterId}`, stakingResult);
}
```

This function allows users to stake a character by interacting with the smart contract, ensuring their participation in DeFi yields while keeping their data encrypted.
